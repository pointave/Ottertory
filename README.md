# Ottertory  

Ottertory provides a **GUI** for handling transcription outputs with a **pop-out live caption box** (adjustable opacity).  
It can output transcriptions in real time to your **default microphone input** (default recording device) and to **VB-Cable Output** (a virtual audio output device). 

Outputs can be copied, have Kokoro TTS read it out loud, Ollama/LMstudio can summarize or any custom command (eg. translate). Recording usually goes in the live transcription box but you can change it to type in the Ollama Custom Command box. 

The shortcut to toggle record is **Alt+Z**. 

> For best accuracy, I still recommend my other app [Antistentorian](https://github.com/pointave/Antistentorian), which uses **Whisper** or **Parakeet**.  
> However, the **Kyutai Moshi** model is very responsive and accurate (trained only on French and English).

## (Optional) System Audio Capture with VB-Cable

If you want to record system audio in addition to microphone input:

1. **Install [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)** and restart your computer.
2. Open **Sound Settings** â†’ set **Cable Input** as your *default playback device*.
3. Go to the **Recording tab** â†’ right-click **Cable Output** â†’ **Properties**:

   * Check **Listen to this device**
   * Set playback to your normal output device (e.g., headphones, TV, or speakers)
4. Keep your microphone as the **default recording device**.

This routes system audio into Ottertory while preserving your microphone input. Changing default audio device will change your volume knob though...

TIP :  Win+Ctrl+V   will pop up Windows quick audio device selector
